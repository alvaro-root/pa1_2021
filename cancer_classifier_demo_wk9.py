"""Classifier for a sample breast cancer dataset
See the accompanying PDF on Brightspace for a diagram representing the process described in this example.

This example is further elaborated in Chapter 10 of Punch & Enbody.

There are many datasets available to anyone for the purpose of data analysis. One such is a dataset of breast cancer
biopsy data from the University of California-Irvine. The original source is from University of Wisconsin Hospitals in
Madison, Wisconsin.

The problem is to determine, based on tumour attributes, whether the tumour is benign or malignant. The data lists about
699 patients with nine tumour attributes for each as well as a result, determined by an oncologist, stating whether the
tumour was benign or malignant.

Thus, for each patient, we have 11 data elements - an ID, nine tumour attributes and a result (4 =benign, 2 = malignant).

By examining the data, we hope to 'predict' based on the attributes alone whether a tumour is benign or malignant. As we
already know the result we can check the quality of our algorithm so that we might usefully apply it to data where we
don't know the result in advance.

Approach: Classification
A classifier begins by training on examples with known solutions. In training, a classifier looks for patterns that
indicate classification. After patterns have been identified, they are tested against "new" examples with known
classification.

Process overview
1. Create training set from data
2. Create classifier using training dataset to determine separator values for each attribute
3. Create test dataset
4. Use classifier to classify data in test set while maintaining accuracy score

Each data row consists of a patient id followed by nine indicators followed by an overall result.Â 
Sample data row: '1000025','5','1','1','1','2','1','3','1','1','2'. In this case '1000025 is the patient id and the
overall result is indicated as '2' - benign or '4' - malignant.
